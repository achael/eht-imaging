ehtim (eht-imaging)
===================

Python modules for simulating and manipulating VLBI (Very-long-baseline interferometry - is a type of astronomical interferometry used in radio astronomy.) data and producing images with regularized maximum likelihood methods. This version is an early release so please submit a pull request or email achael@cfa.harvard.edu if you have trouble or need help for your application.

The package contains several primary classes for loading, simulating, and manipulating VLBI data. The main classes are the ``Image``, ``Array``, ``Obsdata``, ``Imager``, and ``Caltable`` classes, which provide tools for loading images and data, producing simulated data from realistic u-v tracks,  calibrating, inspecting, and  plotting data, and producing images from data sets in various polarizations using various data terms and regularizers.


Installation
------------
Download the latest version from the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/achael/eht-imaging>`_, change to the main directory and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install .

It should install most of the required libraries automatically (`astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`_, `ephem <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyephem/>`_, `future <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/future>`_, `h5py <http://www.h5py.org/>`_ , `html <http://www.decalage.info/python/html>`_ , `networkx <https://networkx.github.io/>`_, `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_, `pandas <http://www.pandas.pydata.org/>`_ , `matplotlib <http://www.matplotlib.org/>`_,  `requests <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/>`_, `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_, `skimage <https://scikit-image.org/>`_).

**If you want to use fast fourier transforms, you will also need to separately install** `NFFT <https://github.com/NFFT/nfft>`_ **and its** `pynfft wrapper <https://github.com/ghisvail/pyNFFT/>`_. The simplest way is to use `conda <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pynfft/>`__ to install both:


.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge pynfft

Alternatively, first install NFFT manually following the instructions on the `readme <https://github.com/NFFT/nfft>`_, making sure to use the ``--enable-openmp`` flag in compilation. Then install `pynfft <https://github.com/ghisvail/pyNFFT/>`_, with pip, following the readme instructions to link the installation to where you installed NFFT. Finally, reinstall ehtim.

Documentation
-------------
Documentation is  `here <https://achael.github.io/eht-imaging>`_ .

Here are some ways to learn to use the code:

- Start with the script examples/example.py, which contains a series of sample commands to load an image and array, generate data, and produce an image with various imaging algorithms.

- `Slides <https://www.dropbox.com/s/7533ucj8bt54yh7/Bouman_Chael.pdf?dl=0>`_ from the EHT2016 data generation and imaging workshop contain a tutorial on generating data with the vlbi imaging `website <http://vlbiimaging.csail.mit.edu>`_, loading into the library, and producing an image. Note that this presentation used a previous version of the code -- some function names and prefixes may need to be updated.
